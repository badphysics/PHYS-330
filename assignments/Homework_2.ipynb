    "**Due:** 14th Sept 2017 by the start of class. Anything later will be considered late.\n",
    "Instructions: Complete all of the questions below. You are encouraged to use Jupyter Notebooks to complete any numerical work and written. While the use of python is encouraged, you can use any programming language you want. You can either email me your assignment or provide me with a hard copy in class.\n",

Take $Y_0=0.66$, $U_1=0.02$, and $U_3 = 0.08$.  Numerically solve the system of differential equations and make plots of $X(\\tau)$, $Y(\\tau)$ and $Z(\\tau)$.  Also plot $Y(Z)$ and $Y(X)$.
